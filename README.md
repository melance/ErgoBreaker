# ErgoBreaker
A small app that hides in your notification tray and reminds you at regular intervals to take a break from the computer.

ErgoBreaker acts as a reminder to take a break at regular intervals during the day when working on a computer. The length of time between breaks, the length of breaks, the appearance of the break screen, and much more can be configured in the application. While running, ErgoBreaker sits in the notification area of your taskbar. Right clicking the icon will popup a menu of actions including Options, Take a Break, and Exit. Shortly before it is time to take a break, a notification window will popup in the bottom right corner of your screen and will count down to the break. You can cancel, delay, or start the break from inside of this notification. On the options window you will find a number of customization options available to make ErgoBreaker work the way you would like.
